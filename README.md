# 327-Term-Assignment-1
The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with peer to peer (P2P)
networks and having a client act as a server. You may work on this project in pairs.
Design a program which allows two or more computers to synchronize files across a local area network
(LAN). Each computer should run its own local instance of the client software, and the files which will be
synchronized should be able to be synchronized multi-directionally.
